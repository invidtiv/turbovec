# py-turboquant

Python implementation of TurboQuant for vector search.

Compresses high-dimensional vectors to 2-4 bits per coordinate with near-optimal distortion. Data-oblivious (no training), zero indexing time.

Unofficial implementation of [TurboQuant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874) (Google Research, ICLR 2026).

## Usage

```python
from turboquant import TurboQuantIndex

index = TurboQuantIndex(dim=1536, bit_width=4)
index.add(vectors)
index.add(more_vectors)

scores, indices = index.search(query, k=10)

index.write("my_index.tq")
loaded = TurboQuantIndex.load("my_index.tq")
```

## Performance vs FAISS

TurboQuant vs FAISS IndexPQFastScan on OpenAI DBpedia d=1536 (100K vectors, 1K queries, k=64). FAISS PQ configurations sized to match TurboQuant compression ratios.

**TurboQuant requires zero training.** FAISS PQ needs a training step (4-10 seconds). TurboQuant index build is 3-4x faster.

### ARM (Apple Silicon M3 Max)

| | TQ speed | FAISS speed | Ratio | TQ recall@1 | FAISS recall@1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2-bit MT** | 0.125ms/q | 0.128ms/q | **0.97x** | 0.860 | 0.882 |
| **2-bit ST** | 1.272ms/q | 1.247ms/q | 1.02x | 0.860 | 0.882 |
| **4-bit MT** | 0.232ms/q | 0.246ms/q | **0.94x** | 0.930 | 0.930 |
| **4-bit ST** | 2.474ms/q | 2.485ms/q | **1.00x** | 0.930 | 0.930 |

On ARM, TurboQuant **matches or beats FAISS** across the board while requiring no training step.

### x86 (Intel Sapphire Rapids, 4 vCPUs)

| | TQ speed | FAISS speed | Ratio | TQ recall@1 | FAISS recall@1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2-bit MT** | 0.733ms/q | 0.590ms/q | 1.24x | 0.860 | 0.882 |
| **2-bit ST** | 1.443ms/q | 1.208ms/q | 1.19x | 0.860 | 0.882 |
| **4-bit MT** | 1.391ms/q | 1.181ms/q | 1.18x | 0.930 | 0.930 |
| **4-bit ST** | 2.998ms/q | 2.477ms/q | 1.21x | 0.930 | 0.930 |

On x86, TurboQuant is within 18-25% of FAISS. The gap is primarily from TurboQuant's rotation step (required by the algorithm, ~5% of total time) and differences in AVX2 code generation vs FAISS's template-instantiated C++ kernels.

### Compression

| Bit width | Index size (100K x 1536) | Compression vs FP32 |
|:----------|:------------------------|:--------------------|
| 2-bit     | 37.0 MB                  | 15.8x               |
| 4-bit     | 73.6 MB                  | 8.0x                |

## How it works

Each vector is a direction on a high-dimensional hypersphere. TurboQuant compresses these directions using a simple insight: after applying a random rotation, every coordinate follows a known distribution -- regardless of the input data.

**1. Normalize.** Strip the length (norm) from each vector and store it as a single float. Now every vector is a unit direction on the hypersphere.

**2. Random rotation.** Multiply all vectors by the same random orthogonal matrix. After rotation, each coordinate independently follows a Beta distribution that converges to Gaussian N(0, 1/d) in high dimensions. This holds for any input data -- the rotation makes the coordinate distribution predictable.

**3. Lloyd-Max scalar quantization.** Since the distribution is known, we can precompute the optimal way to bucket each coordinate. For 2-bit, that's 4 buckets; for 4-bit, 16 buckets. The [Lloyd-Max algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm) finds bucket boundaries and centroids that minimize mean squared error. These are computed once from the math, not from the data.

**4. Bit-pack.** Each coordinate is now a small integer (0-3 for 2-bit, 0-15 for 4-bit). Pack these tightly into bytes. A 1536-dim vector goes from 6,144 bytes (FP32) to 384 bytes (2-bit). That's 16x compression.

**Search.** Instead of decompressing every database vector, we rotate the query once into the same domain and score directly against the codebook values. The scoring kernel uses SIMD intrinsics (NEON on ARM, AVX2 on x86) with nibble-split lookup tables for maximum throughput.

The paper proves this achieves distortion within a factor of 2.7x of the information-theoretic lower bound (Shannon's distortion-rate limit). You cannot do much better for a given number of bits.

**Online by design.** Because the codebook and rotation are derived from math (not from the data), new vectors can be added at any time without rebuilding the index. Each vector is encoded independently in ~4ms at d=1536. Traditional methods like Product Quantization require expensive offline codebook training that must be re-run when data changes.

## Architecture

The search pipeline is implemented in Rust with Python bindings via PyO3:

- **NEON kernel (ARM):** Sequential code layout. `vqtbl1q_u8` shuffle-based LUT scoring with `vaddw_u8` widening accumulation. Per-block heap with QBS=4 query batching.
- **AVX2 kernel (x86):** FAISS-style perm0-interleaved code layout to work around AVX2's cross-lane shuffle constraint. `vpshufb` with uint16 reinterpret trick and `combine2x2` flush. Multi-query NQ=4 scoring with fused heap and SIMD early-rejection.
- **Rotation:** Parallelized chunked GEMM via ndarray. Uses Accelerate (macOS) or OpenBLAS (Linux) when available.
