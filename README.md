# py-turboquant

Python implementation of TurboQuant for vector search.

Compresses high-dimensional vectors to 2-4 bits per coordinate with near-optimal distortion. Data-oblivious (no training), zero indexing time.

Unofficial implementation of [TurboQuant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874) (Google Research, ICLR 2026).

## Usage

```python
from turboquant import TurboQuantIndex

index = TurboQuantIndex.from_vectors(vectors, bit_width=3)
index.add_vectors(more_vectors)

scores, indices = index.search(query, k=10)

index.save("my_index.tq")
loaded = TurboQuantIndex.from_bin("my_index.tq")
```

## How it works

Each vector is a direction on a high-dimensional hypersphere. TurboQuant compresses these directions using a simple insight: after applying a random rotation, every coordinate follows a known distribution — regardless of the input data.

**1. Normalize.** Strip the length (norm) from each vector and store it as a single float. Now every vector is a unit direction on the hypersphere.

**2. Random rotation.** Multiply all vectors by the same random orthogonal matrix. After rotation, each coordinate independently follows a Beta distribution that converges to Gaussian N(0, 1/d) in high dimensions. This holds for any input data — the rotation makes the coordinate distribution predictable.

**3. Lloyd-Max scalar quantization.** Since the distribution is known, we can precompute the optimal way to bucket each coordinate. For 2-bit, that's 4 buckets; for 4-bit, 16 buckets. The [Lloyd-Max algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm) finds bucket boundaries and centroids that minimize mean squared error. These are computed once from the math, not from the data.

**4. Bit-pack.** Each coordinate is now a small integer (0-3 for 2-bit, 0-15 for 4-bit). Pack these tightly into bytes. A 1536-dim vector goes from 6,144 bytes (FP32) to 384 bytes (2-bit). That's 16x compression.

**Search.** Instead of decompressing every database vector, we rotate the query once into the same domain and score directly against the codebook values. Since the rotation is orthogonal: `q . R_inverse(centroids[codes]) = R(q) . centroids[codes]`. One rotation of the query replaces 100K inverse rotations of database vectors.

The paper proves this achieves distortion within a factor of 2.7x of the information-theoretic lower bound (Shannon's distortion-rate limit). You cannot do much better for a given number of bits.
